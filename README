of Cassandra will be available. Downloads of these branches are also provided.

The current master and 0.7.0 branches will work with Apache Cassandra 0.7.x. .  Internal libgenthrift

== libcassie

A C wrapper library for the interface to cassandra generated by libcassandra.

== Install

$ ./config/autorun.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

== Running unit tests

If Google's C++ unit test framework, gtest, is installed on your machine, the unit tests can be run.

$ make check

The unit tests require a cassandra server with the default out of the box storage-conf.xml file to be running.

== Compiling C++ apps with libcassandra

$ g++ file.cc -lcassandra -lthrift -I/usr/local/include/thrift

Obviously, you should modify the line for your include to be where your thrift headers are
installed.

== Compiling C apps with libcassie

$ gcc file.c -lcassie
